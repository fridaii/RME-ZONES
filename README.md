This is  fork of OTA rme that can be found here: https://github.com/OTAcademy/RME
It has zoneId system added, rme edit was made by Oskar (but on old RME, and with one small bug that is fixed in my repo): https://github.com/Oskar1121/RME/pull/3/files

Tutorial for compiling is exactly the same as OTA rme.

This rme is meant to be used with this commit for tfs: https://github.com/fridaii/TFS-ZONES
